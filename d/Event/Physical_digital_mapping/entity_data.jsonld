Where should we place them and how should we best map them to various ways of accessing its digital footprint?\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n* Headstock: maker's logo => aestheticode link to maker's web site\r\n* Front soundboard: official history => (guitar blog?)\r\n* Under strings: technical documentation (accessible by someone who maintains guitar)\r\n* Back: public history (blog, etc.)\r\n* Soundhole: \"voice\" - link to playback of songs\r\n\r\nSee [blog entry](http://carolanguitar.com/2014/08/14/mapping/) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Commentary (meta)\r\n\r\nIs this best modeled as an event?  If so, who/what were involved?",
