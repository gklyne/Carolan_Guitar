  "rdfs:comment": "\"We also need to consider its digital characteristics. Our aim is to create a guitar that tells its own lifestory. But what might this include? Or more technically, what information should appear in our guitar\u2019s \u2018digital footprint\u2019?\"\r\n\r\n## Comments (meta)\r\n\r\nThis phase of the design doesn't appear to be an event so much as a review of considerations.  Modelling it as an event is probably not the right approach, but it's not yet clear what alternatives would be more suitable.  So this is here as a placeholder for possible later review.  For details, see the associated link.\r\n\r\nThis exploratory Digital Music Object is itself a part of an exploration about what the Carolan Guitar's digital footprint might be, and in particular how much of the footprint might be exposed to machine- as well as human- consumption\r\n\r\n(If this stage is to be modeled as an event, I think there should, at least, be an associated person.  Steve?)\r\n",
