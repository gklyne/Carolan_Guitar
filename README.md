# Carolan Guitar

This repository contains an exploratory Digital Music Object design based on the Carolan Guitar,
and is being created as an activity by Oxford University's OeRC inr the EPSRC-funded FAST-IMPACt project.  
The initial approach in this exploration is to create a linked data structure capturing some of the 
information presented in the Carolan Guitar blog at http://carolanguitar.com/, 
using the [Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist) linked data notebook.  

A live verson of this Digital Music Object can be seen at http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/c/Carolan_Guitar/d/

The Carolan Guitar is an acoustic guitar that tells its life story.

The Carolan Guitar project is hosted at the University of Nottingham‘s Mixed Reality Laboratory. 
MRL is a technology research lab dedicated to exploring new ways of interacting with computers. 
Its research focuses on the boundaries between the physical and the digital – hence the name mixed reality – 
and with a particular interest in cultural and creative applications of computers, including music.
