The first is a small Autographer camera that can automatically capture thousands of photos, along with GPS coordinates, automatically triggered by movement and light levels. The second is an Affectiva Q Sensor that can be strapped on to the guitar so as to record accelerometer, gyroscope and temperature data for up to thirty hours at a time.",
