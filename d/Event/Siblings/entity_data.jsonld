This is part of a new five-year research project called FAST that has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to explore new forms of digital music object.\r\n\r\nWe hosted a workshop at the Mixed Reality Lab to build some D-Boxes and design some Artcodes  (the new and more friendly name for Aestheticodes) that might be used to decorate them.\r\n",
